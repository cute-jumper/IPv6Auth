* IPv6Auth
** Overview
   This script can recognize the validcode in the IPv6 authentication
   webpage and then automatically log in. 

   Note: It runs under Python 2.7 and is only applicable when
   accessing IPv6 service in *Tsinghua University*.

** Get Started
   Just run in terminal:
   : python IPv6Auth.py

   Damn the authentication webpage!!!

** Things To Do
   - Change the way to store user information. It should be both
     secure and user-friendly.

** Note
   This a refactoring version of a previous working version.
